I am a master's student at Ocean University of China. My research interests are DeepFake Detection, computer vision, and machine learning.

I am very honored to join Yunzunli's visual analysis and safety research group. You can find relevant information about our research group from [VAS](https://yuezunli.github.io/ligroup/index.html).
